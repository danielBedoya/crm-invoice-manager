    """
    Django management command to generate invoices for all active contracts that do not yet have an invoice for the current billing cycle.
    This command iterates through all active contracts and determines the current billing period key based on the contract's billing cycle (weekly, biweekly, or monthly).
    If an invoice for the current period does not already exist for a contract, a new invoice is created.
    Attributes:
        help (str): Description of the command for Django's help system.
    Methods:
        handle(*args, **options): Main entry point for the command. Generates invoices as needed and outputs the number of invoices created.
